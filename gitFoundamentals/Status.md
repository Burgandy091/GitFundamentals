The command `git status` is extremly helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

Using `git status` will show you what changes are been tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to pushed/pulled,etc. It is exactly what it sounds like, a status check.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "what the landing page name"
git status

git push
git status
