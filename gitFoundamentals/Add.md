#git add

when changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command.

items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

generally, you can get away with the command `git add . ` which will add All the files and directories that were added, changed, r deleted.

you can track changes to specific files using ` git add file1 file2 ` which will track specifically file1 and file2.
-[git add](./commands/Add.md)

you can specify tracking directories with ` git and DirectoryName`.
