# git init

The `git init` command is used to creat an empty git repository.

If you wanted to crate a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
` ` ` 
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
` ` ` 
One inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./Commit.md),
[push](./push.md)
and more

Init will creat the respsitry in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
